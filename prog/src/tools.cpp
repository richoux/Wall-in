 * Wall-in is a C++ library designed for StarCraft: Brood war,
 * making a wall optimizised for a given objective: minimize the
 * number of buildings, the technology needed, the number of gaps
 * between building big enough to let enter small units, etc.
 * To do so, it use some Constraint Programming techniques 
 * like meta-heuristics.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/Wall-in
